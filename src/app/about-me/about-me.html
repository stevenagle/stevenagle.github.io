        <p>
            I'm a Marine veteran, former salesman/marketer and a full stack/back-end software engineer with 8+ years of engineering experience, mostly in the insurance and financial services industries. I specialize in building scalable, enterprise-grade cloud-native applications and REST APIs and translating business needs into technical results to deliver value.

            In my free time you can find me writing (trying to finish my novel), hanging outside, sampling a craft beer with a funny name, or with my family.
